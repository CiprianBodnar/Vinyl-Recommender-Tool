	    <h2><span>1. </span>Abstract</h2>
        <p><strong>Vinyl</strong> (Music Recommender-Tool) is a semantic Web application able to "intelligently" recommend 
		    – by exposing a SPARQL endpoint – vinyl music records according to various criteria: user preferences 
			(specified via controlled natural language constructs such as "I always like/love/prefer classical music,
			especially opera music by Rossini or Verdi and performed by Angela Gheorghiu or Juan Diego Flórez; 
			I sometimes like progressive rock and post-rock; I like only metal albums released before 2000; 
			I always dislike/hate rap and hip-hop; I dislike songs produced by Flood in the last 25 years"), 
			past song purchases on various music stores, playlists – available online via music streaming services 
			Spotify and alternatives – and/or locally (i.e. uploading a JSPF/XSPF document). The playlists could be created 
			by the user or shared by her/his virtual "friends" (consider at least one social network). The system will use 
			several music-related knowledge models (e.g., Music Ontology or MusicRecording concept from schema.org) and available 
			public resources: Free Music Archive, MusicBrainz, Musicmoz Music Styles. Bonus: using Solid principles & tools.</br>
            The main shining features of Vinyl are: easy interlinked search through artists, songs, albums, genres and playlists, 
			lookup on different events related to the artists, create and manage playlists manually or generate "smart" playlists 
			through a series of keywords and the existing created playlists.

                    user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It’s
                    used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also
                    allows us to create reusable UI components. ReactJS allows developers
                    to create large web applications which can change data, without reloading
                    the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.
                    It works only on user interfaces in application. This corresponds to view
                    in the MVC template. ReactJS was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook.

        <p>The Vinyl main storage is the RDF solution <strong>GraphDB</strong>. Every entity is saved in the graph (see the diagram above) by interconnecting the relationship with other entities and properties.</p>

        <p>In the tables below we describe each entities' properties.</p>

        <p>By using the ontology / RDF concepts, MuSeR is able to smartly suggest entities based on the relationships between instances. For example, upon creating a 'smart' playlist, the underlying mechanisms use other playlists created, stored and interlinked inside the RDF storage to suggest similar songs / artists, based on the keywords provided by the user and also on the personal user data.</p>

        <p>The entire ontology was 'packed' under the 'muser' vocabulary. In the following examples, everything without a prefix is assumed to be part of it.</p>

            On the backend side there was some important steps according initial architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            One major outcome was the login part, for that, passport api was used for generate the JWT token in order to grant the access only for those that are registered for in application. The registration was made without any additional library. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to listen those vinyls, the user must have a spotify account that will be matched with the application and authorized. Each recommended vinyl will be displayed in main page of the user. For that, the open Api from Spotify was used. To obtain access, the official guide from them was used.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recommendation was generated through SPARQL queries that were customized by the user  choice though a form where the user must answer in order to know better about. The ontology used was that from DBPedia.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the results from SPARQL query are used in Spotify Api for receiving those jsons with information about song, artist and also info that are consumed by the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            As main architecture from backend, the Model-View-Controller design pattern was used in order to separate the important concepts in implementation. Each concept is in a separate package and the communication between client and server is made through controllers. For the models, mongoose was used in order to ease up the process of storing and receive from database. For the server, express lib is used and all of the controllers use ‘router’ properties.

                As we can observe in the diagram shown above, all of the Vinyl features require the authentication of the user. The user can visualize the already created playlists. During the visualization, users will be able to edit them.

                Another aspect of the application that can be observed in the diagram is the content finding mechanism. Users - for example - can find artists based on keywords specified by them. After finding the desired entity, he can select and add a specific song played by the respective artist into a personal playlist.

                Aside from this, the application will recommend other entities based on relationships of the visualized entity. (e.g. 'Songs from same artist', 'Songs from same Album' etc.)

            <p>
                Vinyl-Recommender-Tool has been created to ease up the management of playlists for music enthusiasts by providing an intuitive platform that uses semantic Web concepts to enhance the
                way of visualizing the relationships between various entities in the context of musical domain. The application can be extended and improved in different ways by conceiving new mechanisms and architectural ideas such as media streaming or machine-learning-related suggesting mechanisms.
